<h1 class="mt-5">Parallel Cover Trees and their use in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</h1>
<p class="lead mb-4">Andrew Pregent</p>
<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Project Outline</h3>
<p>I would like to implement a parallel cover tree data structure as described by Yan Gu et al [1]. Then I would like to compare its efficiency to that of
the more typical spatial hash for finding neighbors within a constant threshold distance in smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations. This search is required both for computing the density field at each particle, and for computing the forces
between particles. A detailed description of SPH can be found in <a href="https://ajp.pages.dev/post/sph/">the following post</a> on my blog, however relevant to this project is that finding
an efficient searching algorithm is critical to the performance of an SPH simulation.</p>
<p>There are two benefits to using a cover tree over a spatial hash. The first is that a spatial hash requires a fixed spatial domain
with which to index points efficiently, whereas the cover tree has no such limitation. A cover tree could therefore be used
in applications where an unbounded spatial domain is desirable. Second, the spatial hash often relies on an assumption about
the support length of the smoothing kernel. This allows particles farther on the grid to be discarded safely. Since a cover tree supports
an approximate search within a distance threshold, it offers an efficient method to support adaptive kernel sizes.</p>
<p>These benefits come with an added complexity cost however. The worst case for both insertion and queries is constant for a spatial
hash, compared with O(logn) for cover trees. Cover trees do have an advantage in memory cost, which is not insignificant for
a spatial hash and is also required to be contiguous. Therefore, in cases where memory becomes the limiting factor in performance the
cover tree has potential to outperform.</p>
<p>I will be interested to see how these factors affect the overall performance between the two methods. For this I plan
to use begin with a variety of standard test cases such as the dam-break test. In addition to this I will test sparse
scenarios which have large domains. In each test I will use an adaptive and fixed size smoothing kernel.</p>
